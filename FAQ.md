## ü§î General Questions

### What is graph-sql?

graph-sql is a Rust CLI tool and library that automatically introspects SQLite databases and generates complete GraphQL APIs with zero configuration. It's designed for rapid prototyping, admin panels, and turning existing databases into modern GraphQL services.

### Who is the target audience?

- **Developers** building prototypes or MVPs who need quick GraphQL APIs
- **Frontend teams** needing backend APIs for development without backend expertise
- **SQLite users** wanting to modernize existing databases with GraphQL
- **Rust developers** looking for a lightweight GraphQL solution
- **Teams** building admin panels or internal tools

### Is graph-sql production-ready?

Currently, graph-sql is in **active development**. While the core functionality is stable, breaking changes may occur. For production use, we recommend:
- Pinning to a specific commit
- Thorough testing of updates
- Using it for internal tools or non-critical applications first

## üöÄ Development & Motivation

### Why did you create graph-sql?

graph-sql was born from several key objectives and philosophy:

1. **Memory Safety Alternative**: Provide a memory-safe alternative to existing GraphQL APIs by leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety guarantees
2. **Simplicity First**: Minimize installation, configuration, and deployment complexity - single binary, zero config
3. **Performance Focus**: Built for heavy load scenarios with Rust's native performance and efficient resource utilization
4. **Database-Centric Architecture**: Act as a lightweight gateway/middleman that lets the database handle business logic and authorization
5. **SQLite Maximization**: Unlock SQLite's full potential as a web API backend, often overlooked in favor of traditional databases

### What problems does graph-sql solve?

- **Memory Safety**: Eliminates entire classes of bugs (buffer overflows, memory leaks) common in traditional API servers
- **Performance at Scale**: Designed to handle heavy loads efficiently with minimal resource overhead
- **Zero Configuration**: Turn any SQLite database into a GraphQL API instantly - no setup, no config files
- **Database-First Logic**: Push business logic to the database layer where it belongs, reducing application complexity
- **Foreign Key Intelligence**: Automatically maps relationships without manual schema definition
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Single binary deployment with no runtime dependencies

### Why focus on SQLite specifically?

SQLite is often underestimated but offers unique advantages for modern applications:
- **Simplicity**: Single file, no server setup required
- **Performance**: Excellent for read-heavy workloads and can handle significant write workloads
- **Deployment**: Easy to deploy, backup, and replicate
- **Edge Computing**: Perfect for edge deployments and serverless functions
- **Extensibility**: Supports extensions (like sqlean) for advanced functionality
- **ACID Compliance**: Full ACID transactions with excellent reliability
- **Embedded Logic**: Can host business logic through stored procedures and extensions

The goal is to make SQLite a first-class citizen for web APIs, not just a development or embedded database.

## üîß Technical Questions

### How does the automatic schema generation work?

graph-sql uses SQLite's built-in introspection capabilities:

1. **Table Discovery**: `PRAGMA table_list` to find all tables
2. **Column Analysis**: `PRAGMA table_info` for column definitions and types
3. **Relationship Detection**: `PRAGMA foreign_key_list` for foreign keys
4. **Type Mapping**: Converts SQLite types to GraphQL scalars
5. **Resolver Generation**: Creates dynamic resolvers for CRUD operations

### What GraphQL features are supported?

Currently supported:
- ‚úÖ **Queries**: List and view operations with pagination
- ‚úÖ **Mutations**: Insert, update, delete operations
- ‚úÖ **Foreign Key Relationships**: Automatic relationship field generation
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Proper nullable/non-nullable field mapping
- ‚úÖ **GraphiQL**: Built-in interactive query interface

Not yet supported:
- ‚ùå **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates
- ‚ùå **Advanced Filtering**: WHERE clauses beyond basic ID lookup
- ‚ùå **Custom Resolvers**: Plugin system for business logic
- ‚ùå **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, AVG operations

### Can I customize the generated schema?

graph-sql follows a **database-first architecture** where business logic lives in the database, not the application layer. As a compiled binary, the CLI application is intentionally not extensible through plugins or custom code.

**Current approach:**
- Schema is automatically generated from database structure
- Business logic should be implemented in SQLite (stored procedures, triggers, constraints)
- Authorization handled by SQLite using JWT claims passed from the gateway

**Future extensibility through SQLite:**
- **SQLite Extensions**: Support for sqlean and other SQLite extensions
- **Database Functions**: Custom SQL functions for business logic
- **Row-Level Security**: Authorization logic implemented in SQLite
- **Triggers and Constraints**: Database-enforced business rules

**Why this approach:**
- **Performance**: Database logic executes faster than application logic
- **Consistency**: Business rules enforced at the data layer
- **Security**: Authorization happens closest to the data
- **Simplicity**: Single binary with no plugin complexity

### What about performance?

graph-sql is designed specifically for **high-performance, heavy-load scenarios**:

**Rust Performance Advantages:**
- **Memory Safety**: Zero-cost abstractions with no garbage collection overhead
- **Native Speed**: Compiled binary performance comparable to C/C++
- **Efficient Concurrency**: Tokio async runtime for handling thousands of concurrent connections
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Low memory footprint and CPU overhead

**Database-First Performance:**
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Business logic executes in SQLite, not over network calls
- **Query Optimization**: SQLite's query planner handles optimization
- **Connection Efficiency**: Single connection pool to database
- **Caching**: SQLite's built-in page cache and query optimization

**Heavy Load Design:**
- **Stateless Gateway**: Pure middleman with no application state
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple instances can serve the same database
- **Resource Efficiency**: Designed to handle high throughput with minimal resources

**Future Performance Features:**
- Data loaders for N+1 query prevention
- Connection pooling optimizations
- Query result caching
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### Will you support other databases?

Yes! The **database-first philosophy** will extend to other databases while maintaining the same core principles:

**Planned Database Support:**
1. **PostgreSQL** (high priority) - with Row Level Security and stored procedures
2. **MySQL** (medium priority) - leveraging stored procedures and user-defined functions
3. **SQL Server** (lower priority) - with T-SQL business logic support

**Consistent Philosophy Across Databases:**
- **Gateway Architecture**: graph-sql remains a stateless middleman
- **Database-First Logic**: Business rules implemented in the database layer
- **JWT Authorization**: Authentication handled by passing JWT claims to database
- **Memory Safety**: Rust performance and safety benefits for all database backends
- **Zero Configuration**: Same simple setup regardless of database

**Database-Specific Features:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Row Level Security, stored procedures, custom types
- **MySQL**: Stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers
- **SQLite**: Extensions (sqlean), custom functions, triggers
- **SQL Server**: T-SQL procedures, user-defined functions, CLR integration

The goal is to unlock the full potential of each database's capabilities while maintaining graph-sql's core principles of simplicity, performance, and database-first architecture.
