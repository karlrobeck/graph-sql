# Comparisons

graph-sql was created to solve specific challenges in modern API development.
Here's how it compares to other popular solutions.

## Why graph-sql?

graph-sql addresses several key challenges:

### Memory Safety at Scale

Traditional GraphQL servers written in languages like Node.js or Go can suffer
from memory leaks, buffer overflows, and garbage collection pauses. graph-sql
leverages Rust's **zero-cost abstractions** and **compile-time memory safety**
to eliminate entire classes of bugs that plague production API servers.

### Database-First Philosophy

Instead of building complex application logic in the API layer, graph-sql pushes
business logic to where it belongs: **the database**. This approach offers:

- **Better Performance**: Database operations are faster than network calls
- **Data Consistency**: Business rules enforced at the data layer
- **Simplified Architecture**: Stateless gateway with no application state
- **Natural Scaling**: Multiple instances can serve the same database

### SQLite Maximization

SQLite is often underestimated but offers unique advantages:

- **Edge Computing**: Perfect for serverless and edge deployments
- **Performance**: Excellent for read-heavy workloads and significant writes
- **Simplicity**: Single file, no server setup, easy backup and replication
- **Extensions**: Support for sqlean and other extensions for advanced
  functionality
- **ACID Compliance**: Full transactions with excellent reliability
